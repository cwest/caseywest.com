I listen to podcasts a lot. My gift to you for the new year is a selection of podcasts I really enjoyed in 2014.

My recommendations are all audio-only because I'm often listening during a commute, shower, walk, or as I'm falling asleep. What did I miss?

# Storytelling

## [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/) by This American Life

This is obviously the breakout show of the year and it definitely got to me. [The post-series interview with Jay](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/12/29/exclusive-interview-jay-wilds-star-witness-adnan-syed-serial-case-pt-1/) definitely keeps the mystery alive.

## [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast)

An essential standard.

## [Welcome to Night Vale](http://podbay.fm/show/536258179) by [Commonplace Books](http://commonplacebooks.com/)

A slightly creepy news cast about a slightly creepy town. Goodnight, Night Vale. Goodnight.

## [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/series/podcasts/) by [WNYC](http://www.wnyc.org/)

Great storytelling on a wide range of subjects.

## [Reply All](http://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/) by Gimlet Media

Like it says, a show about the Internet. Fascinating stories about how the Internet shapes us and how we shape it.

## [StartUp](http://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/) by [Gimlet Media](http://gimletmedia.com/)

A series (like Serial) of episodes recording the journey of one entrepreneur trying to start up.

## [Selected Shorts](http://www.selectedshorts.org/podcast/) by PRI

Short fiction read by actors. Makes me feel like the golden age of radio might still have a place.

## [TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_detail.php?siteId=151446218) by NPR

This is an excellent mashup between TED talks and storytelling, often going behind the scenes or deeper into subjects presented at TED events.

# Ideas

## [TED Talks Audio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tedtalks-audio/id160904630)

These folks are so awesome they compiled all the episodes available into a [Google Spreadsheet](http://blog.ted.com/2010/06/17/audio_podcasts/). I prefer the audio format for listening on the go, but each episode does suggest _"This talk contains powerful visuals."_

## [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/)

Get five minutes of curated news about the Ruby and Ruby on Rails community twice a week (Tuesdays and Fridays).

## [The Ruby Rogues](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues) by [DevChat.TV](http://devchat.tv/)

I have to be honest: this is hit or miss. In the last few months, though, it's been more hits than misses. I like the regulars on the show and someday I hope to be grilled by them about technical leadership. If I am so lucky...

## [The ChangeLog](http://thechangelog.com/)

I like how polyglot this podcast is. Lots of communities get play including, for the first time, Perl just a couple weeks ago. Their [website] also has a nice link blog of interesting open source projects. Keep an eye on it.

# Current Events

## [Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!](http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_detail.php?siteId=344098540) by NPR

Family favorite every weekend.

## [The Rachel Maddow Show](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8132577/t/get-podcasts-nbc-news-msnbc-tv-nbcnewscom/#.VKSL_4rF8v8) on MSNBC

Scroll to the bottom of that page for podcast subscription links. _Warning: political alignment obvious._
