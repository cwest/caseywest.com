  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I prefer values which connect us deeply over rituals and traditions only some of us are able to enjoy.</p>

<h2 id="culture-fit-is-broken">Culture fit is broken.</h2>

<p>The words we use to describe culture matter. We talk about the rituals and traditions we enjoy together. In agile software development one of the traditions we like is standups. Some of our rituals include drinking coffee and alcohol. It's very important to us. I'm a self-described "beverage enthusiast" so I'm no stranger to these rituals. These are ways to bring some people together, but when we're creatively building something we must dig deeper to describe what we value in our collaborative interactions.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote-left" data-pullquote="Never in the history of my career has my ability to drink beer made me better at solving a business problem.">
Here are some rituals and traditions that might bring us together. <em>"She doesn't like SVN either,"</em> perhaps at an interview, convinces us she's likeminded. Do you enjoy ping pong? At <a href="http://pivotal.io">Pivotal</a> we play a lot of ping pong. I'm not excited about it, I'm not very good at it, but ping pong doesn't make me good at my job. I enjoy drinking great beer socially! Never in the history of my career has my ability to drink beer made me better at solving a business problem. I would venture a guess that's true for you, too.
</span></p>

<p>That's too superficial. Let's think more deeply about the values which really bind us together when we're creative and building things.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-value">What do you value?</h2>

<p>Here are some values which shape the my decisions about which organizations and communities I create with.</p>

<p>I value <em>blame-free failure</em>. I value working with people who are willing to take risks, in an organization that's willing to take risks. If I can take big risks there might be big rewards, but there might also be big mistakes, and that's ok. I want to work with people who are comfortable with that. I value <em>growth through mistakes</em> which are, often, our best learning opportunities.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote-right" data-pullquote="My idea of work-life balance is not the same as yours and that&apos;s ok.">
I love <em>sharing.</em> I like sharing success, responsibility, work, and time. Most of all I love sharing ideas, and working with people who are constantly putting their ideas out there.</span></p>

<p>I mentioned taking risks and making mistakes. I value working with people tell me how they feel about the work I've done, let me know the good and the bad, so I can grow from that. I want to provide the same for others. I value <em>continuous learning</em> through <em>continuous feedback.</em> I don't want problems to pile up on each other and become big.</p>

<p>I like <em>balance.</em> My idea of work-life balance is not the same as yours and that's ok. I have children, not everyone has children, but I can't work 16 hours a day even though I love what I do. Maybe you can and that works for you but we should try to build a culture that can support both lifestyles, and more.</p>

<p>These are some of things that really bind us together when we're working, they really matter. But when we're in an interview or considering what sort of community to build we tend to focus on whether or not we enjoyed coffee or had a good time at lunch. That's not really deep enough to build a strong community.</p>

<h2 id="seek-value-fit">Seek value fit.</h2>

<p>Consider how our values, the core principles of our character, fit together when building a community and working with one another. Not everyone likes coffee. Not everyone likes beer. Not every can pop off to the pub after work to make critical business decisions over a pint, so maybe we shouldn't be doing that.</p>

<p><span class="pullquote-left" data-pullquote="Hegemony isn&apos;t an accident.">
This boils down to being deliberate about how we make decisions, and how we work together. Hegemony isn't an accident. If you aren't being deliberate about what values bring people in your community together then you're likely to end up with a community of people who are all the same. It's possible you will look different, or be different genders, but you're more likely to have the same experiences and lifestyles. This doesn't translate into a deeper level of inclusion.
</span></p>

<p>Consider the way our values bring us together rather than the rituals and traditions we occassionally enjoy.</p>

<h2 id="seek-inclusion">Seek inclusion.</h2>

<p>Rituals and traditions are helpful but superficial ways to bring people together. Unfortunately they only bring some people together. By all means have a good time at Whiskey Friday—I will—but don't fool yourself into thinking it's an inclusive event. In fact if everyone in your organization raises a glass at Whiskey Friday you've created a culutre of rituals, not values, and that homogeneous culture is not diverse enough for me.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you.</h2>

<p>Thanks to the organizers of Ignite Velocity 2015 New York, the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop 2015, OSDC 2015, and Cloud Foundry Summit Berlin 2015 for giving me five minutes to talk about this at each of your events. I gave this talk four times in three weeks on three different continents.

    <p>I was honored to speak at <a href="http://yapcasia.org/2015/">YAPC::Asia 2015</a> in August. It was a well-organized conference, and the attendees and speakers were all friendly and fun.</p>

<p>Most of the talks I went to were English-language based. I saw excellent talks on <a href="http://yapcasia.org/2015/talk/show/e19fe827-13c1-11e5-aca1-525412004261">kubernetes</a>, <a href="http://yapcasia.org/2015/talk/show/21cb8176-065b-11e5-9492-79c97d574c3a">docker</a>, <a href="http://yapcasia.org/2015/talk/show/bd04b86c-f9de-11e4-b996-8ab37d574c3a">refactoring</a>, <a href="http://yapcasia.org/2015/talk/show/6bde6c69-187a-11e5-aca1-525412004261">golang</a>, and <a href="http://yapcasia.org/2015/talk/show/b03162be-0052-11e5-ba92-89c77d574c3a">lattice</a>. Fellow Pittsburgh engineer <a href="http://blog.maryloulenhart.com/yapcasia-2015/">Marylou Lenhart</a> also spoke at the conference about <a href="http://yapcasia.org/2015/talk/show/e466d60a-11db-11e5-b07b-d7f07d574c3a">posture for engineers</a>, and I'll be trying to do my <em>cat/cow</em> stretches regularly.</p>

<p><a href="http://yapcasia.org/2015/talk/show/a06d9970-0d7b-11e5-aaf9-67dc7d574c3a">My talk</a> was about working remotely and working on distributed teams. It was based on my writing on <a href="http://caseywest.com/durable-communication/">durable communication</a>. I got a lot of excellent questions after my talk and at the official dinner, and the feedback was quite positive. My <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/caseywest/conways-law-of-distributed-work">slides</a> are online and the organizing team has already posted the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhPHVEGY-6A">video</a>:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FhPHVEGY-6A" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Since I was speaking in English the conference provided live translation into Japense. It was an incredible experience. I felt like a diplomat, especially during Q&amp;A when questions in Japanese were translated into English so I could understand them. The translators were wonderful and I'm very thankful they were available.</p>

<p>Finally, thank you to <a href="https://medium.com/@lestrrat/the-10th-and-final-yapc-asia-tokyo-6bf15dae1ab4">Daisuke Maki</a> for inviting me to speak this year!</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The mission of a DevOps team is to eliminate itself.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/for-posts/devops-gears-team.jpg" alt="DevOps as a Team (DOaaT)" />

</figure>

<p>DevOps is a practice, not a role. It's like <a href="http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/">agility</a>. <em>Does your company have an agile team?</em> From Dave Thomas's agility redux:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>You aren’t an agile programmer—you’re a programmer who programs with agility.</li>
    <li>You don’t work on an agile team—your team exhibits agility.</li>
    <li>You don’t use agile tools—you use tools that enhance your agility.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The same applies to the practice of DevOps. I suggest:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You aren't a DevOps programmer—you're a programmer who automates deployment and operations.</li>
  <li>You don't work on a DevOps team—your team runs the applications you build.</li>
  <li>You don't use DevOps tools—you use tools that enhance your ability to ship business value.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your company has created a dedicated "DevOps team" it signals one of two likely scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Things are already on fire and you're trying to catch up because you're late, or</li>
  <li>You haven't realized that DevOps is a practice, like "agile", and your implementation of the concepts may be faulty.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have built DevOps teams (responding to scenario #1, everything is on fire) and the goal of that team is always to pay the up-front investment in modernizing the software delivery pipeline. Once the investment is paid thier role is to empower engineers to run the software they create themselves, and to enable operators to avoid fires in production and get a good night's sleep. Once that equilibrium is reached it's time to move on to work which genuinely creates business value.</p>

<p>If your organization has a long-lived "DevOps team" and the idea is they'll always be around, how is that different from "throwing it over the wall?" In this case it's just a second wall to an intermediary team between IT and engineering, and it isn't really a good long-term strategy. It can, however, get you over the initial changes required to embrace the DevOps ideal of "you built it, you run it."</p>

<p>It isn't a negative that DevOps teams are created. The rationale for their existence is often quite positive, just that the implementation isn't quite as polished and inline with the intent of the DevOps movement. It should be seen as a short-term tactic and you need to have a long-term strategy. Your DevOps team will never generate business value directly, so your sustained investment isn't wise.</p>

<p>The reduction of <a href="the time it takes to create and deliver business value">cycle time</a> is, without question, a strategic advantage. Your dedicated DevOps team can get you from waterfall to agility much faster, and reduce cycle time drastically, which is a significant improvement in the short term. As the health of your architecture improves, and isn't materially affected by modification (deployment), the value gained by sustained investment in a DevOps team goes down. <strong>This is good.</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.fiercedevops.com/story/newest-member-your-devops-team-may-be-someone-business/2015-07-16">recent report by Nancy Gohring of FierceDevOps</a> suggests a new approach to solidifying the gap between engineering and IT: adding business people to its DevOps teams. (This reporting is not confirmed by Netflix, the company cited as its example.)</p>

<p>If you have a DevOps team their focus should be the reduction of operational costs over time, to the point where the [software deployment pipeline] is automated and the engineering and operations teams are well educated. A well automated pipeline enables engineering teams to bring their business value to customers: shipping. Educating both engineering and operations on <em>how</em> to automate and manage your architecture empowers them to do it themselves, which distributes knowledge and reduces your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> risk.</p>

<p>At this point you've achieved the success of enabling and empowering <em>everyone</em> in your product delivery organization to practice DevOps. Like the practice of agility, DevOps should be a consistent undertone as engineering delivers business value with low operational overhead.</p>

<p>Don't focus on operating your business. Focus on building it.</p>
